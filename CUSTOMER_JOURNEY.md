# The Student-Sponsor Journey: From Learning to Earning

This document explains the journey of a student using the Education Platform, from enrolling in their first course to building a network and earning enough to progress through the entire system. We'll follow a fictional student named **Alex**.

## Part 1: The Beginning - Alex Joins Course 1

1.  **Enrollment**: Alex pays the price for **Course 1** (e.g., $15) and starts learning.
2.  **The Goal**: Alex's immediate goal is to unlock **Course 2** (e.g., $100) without paying out-of-pocket. This $100 becomes Alex's **Target**.
3.  **Sponsoring**: Alex loves the platform and decides to become a sponsor. Alex recruits 3 new students into Course 1. This is the **Multiplier** in action. These 3 students form Alex's **Level 1** downline.
4.  **Earning Commission**:
    *   When these 3 students pay for Course 1, Alex earns a commission on their fees (e.g., 15%).
    *   The calculator's **Reserve Percentage** (e.g., 100%) determines how this commission is split.
    *   **To Target**: A portion of the commission is automatically saved to meet the **Target** (the $100 for Course 2).
    *   **To Wallet**: The remaining portion goes into Alex's **Wallet Earnings**, which is spendable cash. If the Reserve Percentage is 100%, all initial earnings go towards the target.

5.  **Network Growth**: Alex's 3 students also become sponsors and each recruits 3 more students. This creates **Level 2** of Alex's downline (9 new students). Alex also earns a commission from these Level 2 students, and this continues for all **Payout Levels**.

6.  **Graduation**: As Alex's network grows, the funds reserved for the **Target** accumulate. Once the reserved amount reaches $100, Alex automatically "graduates" and unlocks **Course 2**.

## Part 2: Leveling Up - Alex Enters Course 2

1.  **Two Networks**: Alex is now a student in Course 2. Alex now has two distinct networks:
    *   **Course 1 Network**: This network continues to grow on its own as students within it keep sponsoring. It generates a steady, passive income stream for Alex that goes directly into the **Wallet**, because the target for Course 2 has already been met.
    *   **Course 2 Network**: Alex can now start sponsoring new students directly into Course 2.

2.  **Rinse and Repeat**: The process from Part 1 repeats. Alex's new goal is to meet the **Target** for **Course 3** (e.g., $500). Commissions earned from the new Course 2 network are split between the new Target and Wallet Earnings.

This cycle continues for all subsequent courses. With each new course Alex unlocks, a new potential income stream is created, while the previous networks continue to generate passive wallet income.

## Part 3: The End Game - The Final Course

1.  **No More Targets**: When Alex finally unlocks the **Final Course**, there is no "next course" to save up for. The concept of a **Target** disappears for this course.
2.  **100% to Wallet**: All commissions Alex earns from the Final Course network go directly into the **Wallet Earnings**. The **Reserve Percentage** no longer applies.
3.  **Full Passive Income**: At this stage, Alex is earning passive income from every single course network built along the way, with the final and most lucrative course contributing 100% of its commissions to the wallet.

## Understanding the Calculator Tabs

*   **Course Tabs (Course 1, Course 2, etc.)**: Each tab shows a *snapshot* of what's required to graduate from that specific course. It calculates the number of students needed in the downline to hit the next course's price (the Target).

*   **Time Simulation Tab**: This tab projects the entire journey over time (e.g., weeks). It assumes the network grows by one level each period. It shows:
    *   How earnings accumulate period by period.
    *   When you are projected to unlock the next course.
    *   The growth of your total wallet balance over time.

*   **Full Cascade Snapshot**: This is a theoretical projection. It calculates the total size and depth the **Course 1 network** would need to become for a single sponsor's entire downline to *also* progress through every single course. It models the ideal, long-term potential of a single network.

## An Important Note on How the Simulation Works

The calculator uses a simplified model for its projections to make forecasting possible. It's important to understand these assumptions:

1.  **The Calculator Models *Your* Journey:** The main tabs calculate what *you* need to earn to progress. It does not simulate the individual graduation paths of every student you sponsor.

2.  **The Time Simulation Assumes Independent Networks:** When you unlock a new course (e.g., Course 2), the simulation projects your potential earnings by assuming you begin building a *brand new, separate network* for that course. It does not currently model your Course 1 students graduating and "feeding into" your Course 2 network, which would be a much more complex simulation.

This means that the idea of receiving incremental commissions as your downline saves up for their next course is a more dynamic, real-world scenario. The current tool provides a higher-level forecast based on the simpler, independent network assumption.

## Key Terms Glossary

*   **Sponsor**: A student who recruits other students.
*   **Downline**: The network of students recruited by a sponsor and their recruits.
*   **Multiplier**: The number of students each person is expected to recruit (e.g., 3).
*   **Payout Levels**: How many levels deep a sponsor earns commissions from.
*   **Target**: The price of the next course, which you must earn to unlock it.
*   **Reserve Percentage**: The portion of pre-target earnings automatically set aside to meet the Target.
*   **Wallet Earnings**: The take-home portion of earnings that you can spend.

This journey illustrates how a student can leverage the platform's network effect, turning an initial course fee into a series of self-funding educational upgrades and multiple streams of passive income.
